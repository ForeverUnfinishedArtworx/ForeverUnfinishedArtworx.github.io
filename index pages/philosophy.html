                    <div><h2>My Ethos has developed over the years but its roots are deep in my experience with boxing as a youth.</h2>
						<h3>I believe every man should develop an ethos, a code that you live by and truly believe in. If you don't develop one yourself someone will surely do it for you.</h3>
					</div>
						<p>When I was young I got picked on a lot and developed a huge obligation to stand up against injustice and bullying. I really took a liking to boxing and as it would turn out had a knack for the sport. I hung out quite a bit at a local gym called The Pitt. My family couldn't afford the cost to sign me up there but I would still go and watch the guys fight and train. I learned a lot about myself in those days and what it really meant to be tough and to have courage. I carried that philosophy with me throughout the years and have continued to develop it. Interesting how the lessons learned in the ring are often in line with the problems and challenges life presents to us outside of it. <br>A few things I hold true to keep my moral compass aimed north</br></p>
	<ul>
		<div>
			<li><h2>Mental toughness</h2>
				<p>Character and mental toughness are considered the most important aspects of athletic success</p>
			</li> 
			<li><h2>Facing your fears</h2> 
				<p>Getting in the ring with your fears can help you develop moral virtue and be less likely to succumb to fear when doing the right thing.</p>
		    </li>
		    <li><h2>Resolve</h2> 
				<p>A great fighter has the resolve to survive and thrive in any situation.<p>
			</li>
			<li><h2>Brains over brawn</h2>
				<p>Bigger isn’t always better, and might doesn’t always make right</p> 
			</li>	
	</ul>			
				<br><p>I often reference him in my day to day,<br> Bruce Lee once said his style was the art of fighting without fighting  which I love to demonstrate to anyone curious. Read <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Bruce_Lee_Jeet_Kune_Do/XLmHCgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA7&printsec=frontcover"> Tao of Jeet Kun Do</a> if you are interested in another interview he said "I do not believe in styles, styles separate man. Its a process of continuing growth" "Be water my Friend." -Bruce Lee</p>
