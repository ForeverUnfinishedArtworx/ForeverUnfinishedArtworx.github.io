White Paper
Published: May 11, 2025
Forever Unfinished Artworx (FUArtworx)
Faux Fox Foundry, Neon Grid

Executive Summary
Forever Unfinished Artworx (FUArtworx), pronounced “fox,” is a dynamic art enterprise led by Remington Braninburg, a self-taught artist, coder, and polymath. Operating from the neon-charged, gritty crucible of Faux Fox Foundry, FUArtworx merges urban street art, cyberpunk aesthetics, and 80s pop art influences with cutting-edge technology to create exclusive, high-quality artwork and streetwear. Our mission is to inspire and empower creators—tinkerers, doers, builders, and the beautifully unconventional—to embrace their unique vision through rebellious, “perfectly imperfect” art.
FUArtworx offers original paintings, print-on-demand (POD) streetwear (t-shirts, hoodies, stickers), and digital assets like NFTs, all infused with our signature FUAX Face logo and Neon Symbol series. Our art reflects a dystopian, retro-futuristic ethos, forged in the chaos of Faux Fox Foundry, where neon meets grit. We target tech-savvy artists, designers, and innovators who thrive at the intersection of creativity and technology, rallying them as our Dryftrs community.
This white paper outlines FUArtworx’s mission, vision, business model, growth timelines, and value proposition for patrons and investors. With a lean, AI-powered operation and a self-coded digital hub (fuax-art/99.github.io), FUArtworx is poised to redefine cyberpunk streetwear and digital art, inviting you to join the rebellion.





Mission Statement
At Forever Unfinished Artworx, our mission is to forge rebellious, high-quality artwork that resonates with and inspires a global audience of creators. We blend urban street art, cyberpunk futures, and 80s pop art with technological innovation to produce original paintings, streetwear, and digital assets that embody “perfect imperfection.” Led by Remington Braninburg—father, fighter, artist, poet, and self-taught coder—FUArtworx champions creativity, authenticity, and inclusivity, empowering tinkerers, doers, builders, and the unconventional to explore the uncharted intersection of art and technology.

Vision
FUArtworx envisions a world where art and technology collide to spark a cyberpunk streetwear movement, driven by the Dryftrs—a vibrant community of creators who defy convention. From Faux Fox Foundry, we aim to:
Redefine Artistry: Push the boundaries of urban street art and digital abstraction, creating limited-edition streetwear and NFTs that capture dystopian rebellion.
Empower Creators: Inspire tech-savvy artists, designers, and innovators to embrace their unique vision, using FUArtworx as a platform for experimentation.
Build a Legacy: Establish FUArtworx as a global leader in cyberpunk art, with Faux Fox Foundry as the neon-lit crucible where creativity is forged.
Scale Sustainably: Leverage AI tools, a self-coded digital hub (fuax-art/99.github.io), and strategic partnerships to grow FUArtworx while staying true to our DIY, blue-collar roots.
Our vision is not static—it’s forever unfinished, evolving with the grit and glow of Faux Fox Foundry.

About FUArtworx
The FUAX Ethos
FUArtworx, pronounced “fox,” is more than an art brand—it’s a rebellion. Our name, a playful nod to “faux,” reflects our embrace of duality: authentic yet subversive, gritty yet futuristic. Founded by Remington Braninburg, a “Stationary Timewalker” and “scientific magic wielder,” FUArtworx channels his bipolar and ADD superpowers into art that defies convention. As Remington puts it, “Just a question of which one of me is for the hour? Father, Fighter, Artist, Poet, Convict, Addict? Whiskey neat or a whiskey sour?” This raw, multifaceted identity fuels FUArtworx’s “perfect imperfection.”
Faux Fox Foundry
Our creative crucible, Faux Fox Foundry, is where neon meets grit to forge rebellious art. Picture a dystopian workshop with oil-stained workbenches, clanking wrenches, and glowing CRT monitors displaying HTML/CSS code. Here, urban tinkerers craft Neon Fist tees, FUAX Face paintings, and NFT animations, all infused with cyberpunk chaos and 80s arcade vibes. Faux Fox Foundry is not just a place—it’s a mindset, where no “Fox Paws” (faux pauses) interrupt the grind.
Artistic Style
FUArtworx draws inspiration from:
Urban Street Art and Graffiti: Bold, spray-painted lines and rebellious tags.
80s Pop Art: Vibrant colors and retro-futuristic scan lines, evoking VHS tapes and arcade games.
Cyberpunk Futures: Neon green/pink palettes, dystopian cityscapes, and futuristic tools like the Neon Fist’s cyberpunk wrench. Our hand-painted originals and digital abstractions bring these elements to life, creating art that’s both tactile and visionary.
Brand Identity
Voice and Tone: Bold, innovative, approachable, and empowering, inviting Dryftrs to join the cyberpunk rebellion.
Personality: Creative, curious, cutting-edge, and experimental, pushing the boundaries of art and technology.
Promise: To inspire and empower creators to bring their unique vision to life.
Values: Creativity, innovation, authenticity, inclusivity.
Target Audience
FUArtworx connects with tech-savvy, unconventional creators aged 18–35, including:
Tinkerers: Curious experimenters who hack, modify, and repurpose to create art.
Doers: Resourceful makers who execute bold visions with grit.
Builders: Visionaries crafting physical and digital works at the art-tech nexus.
Undesirables and Scum of the Earth: Playfully provocative labels for fiercely independent creators who challenge norms, often marginalized yet innovative. This audience, our Dryftrs, thrives on #CyberpunkStreetwear, #Vaporwave, and #AvantApocalypse trends, seeking art that reflects their rebellious spirit.
