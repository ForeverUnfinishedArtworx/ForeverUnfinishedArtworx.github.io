# **My Ethos has developed over the years but its roots are deeep in my experience with boxing as a youth.**

> I believe every man should develop an ethos, a code that you live by and truely believe in. If you dont develop one yourself somone will surely do it for you.  

When I was young I got picked on a lot and developed a huge obligation to stand up against injustice and bullying. I really took a liking to boxing and as it would turn out had a nac for the sport. I hung out quite a bit at a local gym called The Pitt. My family couldnt afford the cost to sign me up there but I would still go and watch the guys fight and train. I learned a lot about myself in those days and what it really meant to be tough and to have courage. I carried that philosophy with me throughout the years and have continued to develop it. Interesting how the lessons learned in the ring are often in line with the probems and challenges life presents to us outside of it. A few things I hold true to keep my moral compass aimed north 

## -**Mental toughness:**

###    > Character and mental toughness are considered the most important aspects of athletic success. 

## -**Facing your fears:** 
    
###    > Getting in the ring with your fears can help you develop moral virtue and be less likely to succumb to fear when doing the right thing.
    
## -**Resolve:**

###     > A great fighter has the resolve to survive and thrive in any situation.

   >> Or in the words of Balboa *"It aint about how hard you can HIT! Its abOUT how HARD YOU can get HIT and get baCK UP AND KEEP GOING..... THATS HOW WINNING IS DONE!*

 ## -**Brains over brawn:**
    
###     > Bigger isn't always better, and might doesn't always make right. 
    I often reference him in my day to day, Bruce Lee once said his style was the art of fighting without fighting which I have practiced since I first read [Tao of Jeet Kune Do](https://ia600908.us.archive.org/32/items/pdfy-SP1dBDr6xLGrVfF9/Tao%20Of%20Jeet%20Kune%20Do.pdf), He further elaborated that he did not actually believe in style, 
    
    > "I do not believe in styles, styles seperate man. Its a process of continuing growth" 
    >> "Be water my Friend." -Bruce Lee
    
    > Reminds me of a time my brother once asked me to show him the art of fighting without fighting. He said it made no sense. How can you fight, without fighting? he asked. I told him that I couldnt show him right then as it was late and we were in my third story apartment. This only drove his curiosity further, I cannot say that I did it on accident. After a while of his pestering to show him accross the way at a local park I said fine, lets go show you how to fight without fighting. 
    >
    >> ###### It should be noted that I let the idea of the park and outside come >>to him on his own accord, though I had definitely planted the seeds. 
    >
    > As we approached the door I politely opened for him, the swiftly shut and locked it behind him. Through the door I deard his laughter as he said  "Aaaah, the art of fighting without fighting," to which I replied "Chess not checkers little Brother, be water,"  
    
    Still to this day I admire Bruce and his ethos. One of my main role models. I definetely reccomend the book even if you have no interest in ever fighting. As a matter of fact if you are interested in fighting this wont be the book for you.
 
 -**Staying  and fighting:**
    
  ###   > You should stay and fight when others turn and run.

- **Learning from experiences:**
     
  ###    > How you control your experiences and learn from them will determine your strength or weakness. 

    I tell my daughter all the time - there is no losing, only winning and learning and winning is learning too. Its only a loss if you dont learn from it, grow from it.
