## My artist portfolio and landing page for ForeverUnfinishedArtworx

> Started with a neat template called global & proceeded to make it my own.   
> Started this journey about two years ago knowing absolutely nothing about git, code, computers or any of this stuff.  
> With the help of this community, a.i. and others online I was able to get here. Hope you enjoy Forever Unfinished Artworx!
