## My artist portfolio and landing page for ForeverUnfinishedArtworx

> Started with a neat template called global & proceeded to make it my own.   
> Started this journey about two years ago knowing absolutely nothing about git, code, computers or any of this stuff.  
> With the help of my brothers, my lady, the never ending love of my daughter, AI and my often Destructive Devotion and Perilous Perseverance  I was able to painstakenly get here. I'dlike to give a big thank you to me. For always having my back, for always knowing deep down that I could and for always getting back up. And for all the times I couldnt I thank my brothers, my girl, my daughter and yes even AI helped me through the darktimes. Hope you enjoy Forever Unfinished Artworx.  https://fuax-art.github.io/99
